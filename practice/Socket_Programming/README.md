# Socket_Programming
- A CLI based project 
- depends on sockets and threading
- In this I have a server to share messages b/w different clients
- we have to run the server and then client.py which tries to connect 
- if it find's the port and ip or in short (address) then client will connect to server
- threading will handle different clients and messaging
