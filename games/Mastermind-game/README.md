# Mastermind-game
In this I have created mastermind game with python. It is GUI based game but I have made it without Gui.
# The user have to guess the code which is made by 4 colors.
# The user will get 10 tries.
# The user will get to know how many colors are at their correct position and how many are incorrect position.
# here incorrect means that color is present in code but not at its right position.
# If user did not guess the code correctly then loose else win.
